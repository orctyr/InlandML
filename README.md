# Input file description
TrainingX.csv: genera abundance of training data. Each row represent one sample, and each column represent one genus

TrainingY.csv: gene abundance of training data. Each row represent one sample, and each column represent one gene

TrainingX.csv and TrainingY.csv should have the same rows.

RealdataX.csv: genera abundance of testing data. Each row represent one sample, and each column represent one genus

RealdataY.csv: gene abundance of testing data. Each row represent one sample, and each column represent one gene

RealdataX.csv and RealdataY.csv should have the same rows.

# pipeline usage
Step1: Select important variables

	perl Model-step01.pl -TrainingX TrainingX.csv -TrainingY TrainingY.csv > step1.sh
	sh step1.sh

Step2: Construct the models and evaluate the performance using real data

	perl Model-step02.pl -TrainingX TrainingX.csv -TrainingY TrainingY.csv -RealdataX RealdataX.csv -RealdataY RealdataY.csv > step2.sh
	sh step2.sh

Step3: Collect the parameters of model preformance and predictive values. "Model-performance-list.txt" was generated by step2 script

	perl Model-step03.pl Model-performance-list.txt Model-Detail.csv
